# Medication-Dispensor
A device to make informal caregivers' jobs easier and is more accurate regarding sorting the medicine and the time it should be consumed. It is made to reduce medication error, a commonly made mistake made by hospital nurses due to the complexity of managing multiple medications, time pressures, and the risk of miscommunication which involves losing/misplacing pills or treating medicine at the wrong time.
